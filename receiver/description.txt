This is an IoT application for a vehicular system that is developed for an electric 
vehicle manufacturer. It receives and examines acceleration and deceleration 
(regenerative braking) data from an electric vehicle (i.e., watt-hours per mile lost 
(Wh/mi), watt-hours per mile gained Wh/mi) as well as environmental data (i.e., 
temperature, elevation, etc.)

The events are acceleration and environmental readings. This electric vehicle has 
regenerative braking which slows down the vehicle by converting kinetic energy and 
recharges the battery while doing so. In theory, this increases the vehicle's range 
and efficiency (Wh/mi). These readings are analyzed throughout the day but the volume 
of readings increases during peak driving times (Monday to Friday 7:00am-9:00am and 
4:00pm-6:00pm) as this is the expected range of commuting time. The expected peak load 
is as many as 4000 requests per second.

The readings are stored to allow the following:
    - Driver's can view real-time live efficiency data.
    - Driver's can view efficiency over a specified period of time.
    - Manufacturer's can view vehicle efficiency data across multiple vehicle's to look 
      for trends in the data (i.e., battery degradation over time, efficiency in different 
      climates, etc.)

The users of this system are the drivers and the vehicle manufacturer.
